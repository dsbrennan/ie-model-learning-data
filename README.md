# IE Model Learning Data
This repository has been setup to contain generated datasets that can be used for evaluating IE model similarity metrics. These can be used for either training data within Machine Learning algorithms, or simply used to evaluate the performance for different graph comparison algorithms.

Each dataset has its own README file which outlines what the dataset contains and how it was generated.
