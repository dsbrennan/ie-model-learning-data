# Dataset Description

**Name**: learning-slab-bridge-500-span-1-9-column-1-1-node-1-3

**Contents**: This dataset contains a total of 4500 simple slab bridges generated by the 'generate_bridge_slab.py' file. There were 500 bridges generated for each span (1-9) with a randomly selected number of columns (1-1) and nodes per span (1-3) for each bridge. Element Geometry and Coordinates were selected based upon random widths (max 5000), heights (max 5000) and lengths (max 5000). Perfect Relationships were selected between every node within a span and between every span to span Relationships. The columns were randomly selected as to which side of the bridge span they had a Static Joint Relationship to (previous, next or both). Each Element type (deck and column) has it's Material type selected from a possible list of:
* metal -> ferrousAlloy
* metal -> aluminiumAlloy
* metal -> nickelAlloy
* metal -> copperAlloy
* metal -> titaniumAlloy
* ceramic -> cement
* composite -> fibre-reinforced

## Generation
The following code was used to generate this dataset.

```
from generate_bridge_slab import generate
from utilities import utilities as utils

# Generate 500 Population of simple slab bridges
utils.population = "learning-slab-bridge-500-span-1-9-column-1-1-node-1-3"
for i in range(1, 10):
    generate(i, i, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5000, 5000, 5000, 500)
