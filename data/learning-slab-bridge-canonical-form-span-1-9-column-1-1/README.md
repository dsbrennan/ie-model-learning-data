# Dataset Description

**Name**: learning-slab-bridge-canonical-form-span-1-9-column-1-1

**Contents**: This dataset contains a total of 9 canonical form simple slab bridges generated by the 'generate_bridge_slab_canonical_form.py' file. There were 1 bridges generated for each span (1-9) with only 1 column per span for each bridge. Elements only contain their type and contextual information (where appropriate). Perfect Relationships were selected between every span to span Relationships. The columns connect to the span via a Static Joint Relationship.

The following code was used to generate this dataset.

```python
from generate_bridge_slab_canonical_form import generate
from iegentool.utilities import utilities as utils

utils.population = "learning-slab-bridge-canonical-form-span-1-9-column-1-1"
generate(1, 10)
