# Dataset Description

**Name**: learning-slab-bridge-interim-canonical-form-span-1-9-column-1-1

**Contents**: This dataset contains a total of 9 interim canonical form simple slab bridges generated by the 'generate_bridge_slab_interim_canonical_form.py' file. There were 1 bridges generated for each span (1-9) with only 1 column per span for each bridge. There is an additional deck element at the beginning of the deck before the spans and another deck elements after the spans.

The columns connect to the span via a Static Joint Relationship.
